# Mr. Ick  
*A playful, judgment-free way for couples to discover their sexual preferences together.*

Mr. Ick is a relationship-strengthening app that helps partners explore, compare, and communicate their desires through a simple swipe-based experience. Think “Tinder for sexual preferences,” designed not for dating but for deeper intimacy, consent, and honest conversation.

## 🧠 What the Product Does
Mr. Ick makes it easy (and fun) for partners to uncover what each person finds exciting, interesting, or off-limits — without awkward conversations or pressure. Each partner swipes “Yum” or “Ick” on a series of cards representing sexual acts, themes, or scenarios. The app then reveals where your preferences match, differ, or might need conversation.
