# Card Illustration Prompt

## Card Title

**Bondage exploration**

*(Replace the title above when generating images for different cards)*

## Image Specifications

- **Aspect Ratio**: Phone portrait format (9:16 ratio)
- **Vertical Padding**: 20% margin on top and bottom (content area uses 60% of vertical space)
- **Dimensions**: Optimized for mobile display
- **Border**: No border on the image

## Style Guidelines

- **Art Style**: Fun, cartoony illustration
- **Background**: White background (not full colored)
- **Shapes**: Soft, rounded shapes
- **Color Palette**: Dark purple and black (used for characters/objects, not background). When illustrating 2 characters, assign contrasting colors (one dark purple, one black) for clear visual distinction.
- **Elements**: Stylized, cartoony elements that directly represent the card title's meaning (not abstract or unrelated)
- **Layout**: Minimal, modern layout

## Content Requirements

- **Characters/Objects**: Simple, cute characters or objects performing an activity that **directly and clearly relates** to the card title. The activity must be an obvious, recognizable representation of the title's meaning — not abstract or loosely connected. The viewer should immediately understand how the action connects to the card title.
- **Activity-Title Connection**: The characters' actions must be the primary visual representation of the card title. Every element of the illustration should reinforce this connection. If the title is about a specific activity, the characters must be shown doing that activity (or a clear, safe, symbolic version of it).
- **Sensitive Topics Guidance**: For themes that could be interpreted as adult-oriented (e.g., bondage, ropes, restraints), represent them in a **playful, innocent, craft-like manner**. Examples:
  - Ropes: Show characters playfully holding, wrapping, or learning to tie decorative knots together — like a fun craft activity or game
  - Restraints: Represent as playful accessories, decorative elements, or craft materials — never as actual restraints
  - Always emphasize the **fun, exploratory, learning-together** aspect rather than any adult implications
  - Think "children's craft activity" or "playful game" energy, not adult activities
- **Clarity**: Clear enough for quick recognition, but never explicit
- **Tone**: Playful, safe, and PG-13
- **Character Count**: Include only 1 or 2 people/characters, unless the card title implies introducing someone else to the relationship (e.g., threesome, group activities)
- **Character Colors**: When there are 2 characters, they must **never be the same color**. They should always use opposite/contrasting colors from the palette (e.g., one dark purple, one black) so they can be easily distinguished and contrasted visually.
- **Restrictions**: 
  - Avoid anything sexual, revealing, or suggestive
  - No real people
  - No explicit imagery

## Text Requirements

- **Include**: Only the card title (as specified in the "Card Title" section above)
- **Position**: Centered and clearly readable
- **No other text**: Do not include any additional text or labels
