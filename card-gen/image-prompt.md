Create a fun, cartoony card illustration in Mr. Ick’s visual style. Use soft, rounded shapes, warm coral and mint tones, and abstract, non-literal elements. Include simple, cute characters or objects performing an activity that symbolically represents the card title — clear enough for quick recognition, but never explicit. Keep all actions playful, safe, and PG-13. Avoid anything sexual, revealing, or suggestive. Include only the card title: Public exhibition, centered and clearly readable. No other text. Use a minimal, modern layout with no real people and no explicit imagery
