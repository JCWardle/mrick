# Purple Heart Logo Generation Prompt

Create a 3D purple heart logo with soft, rounded edges and an abstract, couple-friendly aesthetic. The heart should feature a rich, warm purple gradient transitioning from deeper plum tones at the base to lighter lavender and soft violet highlights at the top, creating depth and dimension. The 3D effect should be subtle and elegant, with gentle shadows and highlights that give it a premium, approachable feel—think soft volumetric lighting rather than harsh edges. Incorporate a subtle, refined texture that feels tactile and inviting, like a soft matte finish with gentle surface variation, avoiding anything too glossy or clinical. The overall shape should be organic and flowing, with no sharp corners, maintaining the brand's playful but mature personality.

The logo should be rendered on a completely transparent background with no elements, shadows, or effects extending beyond the heart itself. The purple palette should feel warm and inviting rather than cold or corporate, using tones that evoke connection and intimacy while remaining tasteful and modern. The texture should be subtle enough to add visual interest without overwhelming the form—think of a premium fabric or soft ceramic finish that suggests quality and care. The 3D dimensionality should enhance the heart's organic shape, making it feel approachable and touchable, perfectly suited for a couples-focused app that values warmth, playfulness, and trust.
