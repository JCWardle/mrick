Market Sizing & Demand
The overall global sexual‐wellness market is large and growing. For example, one recent report values the global sexual wellness market at roughly $28.5 billion in 2024
emergenresearch.com
, with forecasts of ~$65 billion by 2034. A related “relationship apps for couples” market is estimated at $2.25 billion in 2025 (growing ~12.5% annually)
businessresearchinsights.com
. (These broad figures include everything from e-commerce products to digital couples tools.) Mr. Ick’s TAM can be framed as the subset of adults in partnerships seeking digital tools for sexual communication. Roughly half the adult population globally are partnered – e.g. ~130 M US adults (48% of ~270 M adults) and similar shares in UK/Aus/EU. If even 10–20% of couples use mobile intimacy apps, TAM in USD could approach the low‐single‐digit billions globally (assuming modest ARPU). Regional breakdown (rough estimates): North America (42% share in relationship apps
businessresearchinsights.com
) dominates, followed by Europe (~30%) and Asia-Pacific (~20%)
businessresearchinsights.com
. English-speaking markets (US, UK, Australia) likely represent ~20–25% of TAM. For example, the US has ~65 M couples; if 5 M become active users paying $10–20/year, that’s ~$50–100 M/yr TAM in the US. Similar reasoning gives UK~$10M, Aus~$5M, EU (rest) ~$200M. The SAM (serviceable addressable market) for Mr. Ick would be English‐speaking tech-savvy couples initially – perhaps a few million users. The initial SOM (obtainable in 1–2 years) is likely a small fraction (e.g. 1–5% of US/UK/Aus couples): on the order of 100k–300k users globally. Evidence of demand: Internet interest in “couples sex apps” and related terms is growing. For example, Google Trends shows steady search volume for terms like “sex games for couples” and “couples intimacy app.” Social forums confirm interest: in Reddit threads users frequently ask for apps to share bedroom ideas (e.g. one user raved about finding Spicer to share kinks with a partner)
reddit.com
. Academic studies highlight that sexual communication strongly correlates with relationship satisfaction (meta-analysis finds r≈0.37 between sexual communication and relationship satisfaction
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
). This suggests real user need for tools that facilitate honest sexual discussions. App‐store data also hint at active demand: for example Desire – Couples Game (a “date night” dare app) has 1M+ Android installs
play.google.com
 and Spicer (intimacy quiz) has thousands of ratings. Overall, qualitative and indirect quantitative signals point to a viable niche of couples seeking intimacy-enhancement apps.
Competitive Landscape
Direct competitors (same “yum/ick” use-case):
Kindu (Franklin Innovations LLC): Tinder-style prompts for couples. Each partner swipes yes/no on intimacy suggestions; mutual “yes” appear as matches. Free to download, with optional idea packs or upgrades for additional content
ikanabusinessreview.com
camillestyles.com
. Available on iOS/Android for years with a long-lived user base
ikanabusinessreview.com
. No known VC funding; likely bootstrapped. Data on users is scarce (older reviews note thousands of 5-star ratings). Notably, an industry review calls Kindu “Tinder meets truth-or-dare”
camillestyles.com
 and praises its private match logic.
Spicer (Spicer Limited, Malta): A couples intimacy app with quizzes/dare cards. Both partners answer questions about desires/limits; mutual affirmative answers form a shared match list. Freemium model: free base app + purchasable question packs + optional “Spicer Plus” subscription (monthly or yearly)
apps.apple.com
. Spicer has been featured in media (Cosmopolitan, Men’s Health) and has a 4.6★ rating on iOS from ~3.1K reviews. (Android stats not public; likely tens of thousands of downloads.) Spicer Limited also offers WeShouldTryIt (the app’s web interface) and Nudex (a private photo vault). No disclosed fundraising; appears self-funded by founders.
MojoUpgrade (Desire Technologies, Ltd.): A free web-based sex quiz for couples. Partners answer yes/no on hundreds of sexual preferences; only overlaps are revealed. No app required (HTTPS site)
mojoupgrade.com
. Lacks heavy mobile UI but provides quick compatibility “quiz” for couples, including chat and custom question features. No ads or fees mentioned. The same company runs Desire – Couples Game (below).
Desire – Couples Game (Desire Technologies, Ltd.): A partner-dare game app (dare card mechanics). Has ~1M+ Android installs
play.google.com
 and 4.3★ on iOS (~758 ratings
apps.apple.com
). Free with in-app purchases; optional Platinum monthly subscription unlocks all dare categories and removes ads
apps.apple.com
. No VC funding (founder’s story suggests bootstrapping). Focus is romance/dare game rather than “swipe preferences,” but overlaps in couples intimacy space.
Indirect competitors: General couples or sexual-wellness apps. These include:
Relationship/couples apps: Paired (relationship advice and quizzes), Lasting (guided marriage coaching), Between (private couples messenger). These do NOT focus on sex preferences, but address relationship communication broadly. Paired, for example, has >1M downloads (N/A exact data) and uses a free+subscription model.
Sexual wellness apps: Coral, Rosy, Blueheart, Ferly, Satisfyer Connect/We-Connect (for couples across distance). These typically focus on education, mindfulness or remote device integration. Coral/Blueheart integrate therapy techniques; Rosy targets female libido. While they occupy the broader “sexual health” category, none use a swipe/quizzes matching mechanic.
Questionnaire/web tools: WeShouldTryIt, Kama+ (apparently defunct), OpenCouple (couple flirting app). These might have tens of thousands of users. Also Gottman Card Decks (therapy prompts) and basic quiz apps exist (e.g. Couple Game Quiz). Most are free or pay once, without a robust matching feature.
Adjacent players/ecosystem: Couples therapists and sex educators (who may recommend digital tools); online communities (Reddit r/sex, podcasts) that sometimes reference these apps; sex-tech hardware (e.g. vibrators with apps like We-Vibe) which may integrate software elements. Sex-tech VCs (e.g. Compound, Prehype) are active, but they focus mainly on devices or broader wellness platforms, not specifically couples communication apps. No recent M&A in the tiny “couples app” niche is known; the market remains fragmented.

Business Model & Pricing
Existing monetization: Most competitors use freemium models. For example, Kindu is free with optional paid “idea packs”
ikanabusinessreview.com
. Spicer is free with a subscription ($6–10/mo) for “Spicer Plus” and one-time pack purchases. Desire offers a Platinum subscription (monthly auto-renewal) to unlock premium dares
apps.apple.com
. In-app purchases (IAP) for extra content are common. Advertising is typically not used (adult themes make ads tricky under App Store rules
support.apple.com
). Possible pricing models for Mr. Ick:
Freemium + Subscription: Basic app is free; core swipe feature unlocked at no cost. Premium features (e.g. extra categories, analytics, privacy modes) sold as monthly or annual subscription (~$5–8/mo, as industry norms). Similar to Spicer/Desire.
Pay-per-pack (bundles): Offer “consent decks” or specialized question packs (e.g. BDSM, role-play ideas). Each pack (30–50 prompts) can be bought one-time (e.g. $5–10). This caters to couples who hesitate to subscribe.
B2B/White-label: License the platform to sex therapists, coaches, or relationship counselors as a tool (perhaps at fixed “clinic” pricing). Sell a branded version to clinics or wellness retreats. (Therapists might even pay referral fee for leads.)
Other: In-app tips (crowdfunding), affiliate links (e.g. to sex toy brands) could be considered but risk diluting trust. Given bootstrapping, focus should stay on paid user models.
ARPU/ARPPU assumptions: We model three tiers: Conservative, Realistic, Aggressive. Key assumptions vary conversion (free→paid) and pricing:
Conservative: 5% of users convert to paid; subscription ~$4/mo ⇒ ARPPU ≈$4, ARPU ≈$0.20–0.50.
Realistic: 10% conversion; subscription ~$6/mo ⇒ ARPPU ≈$6, ARPU ≈$0.50–$1.
Aggressive: 15–20% conversion; subscription ~$8–10/mo (or high lifetime spend on packs) ⇒ ARPPU ≈$10, ARPU ≈$1–$2.
These yield roughly ARPU in the range $0.5–2.0 per active user per month. (Actual ARPU depends on mix of monthly vs annual discounts; but cited competitor pricing suggests single-digit monthly subs or $30–60/yr top-ups.)
Go-to-Market & Growth Channels
Likely acquisition channels (with rough CAC estimates):
Organic/App Store (ASO): Content SEO (blog posts on intimacy, keywords “couples game”, “sex quiz”), ASO optimization. Very low direct CAC (<$5/user) but limited volume.
Social Ads (TikTok/Instagram): Target 20–45 age couples, LGBTQ+ friendly. Adult-content ads are restricted on some platforms, but TikTok/IG can run “romance/games” ads. Estimated CAC $20–50 per registered user (since lead gen is hard, and bootstrapped budget is small).
Influencer & Content Marketing: Partner with sex-positive influencers (TikTok, YouTube, bloggers). Seeding with 10–20 micro-influencers ($100–1000 each) could yield engaged niche traffic. Difficult to quantify, but maybe CAC ~$30.
Referral/Viral (Invite Partner): The app invites both partners to install; if one user signs up, they invite partner by email/WhatsApp. Each existing user can bring ~1 new user (K-factor ~0.5–1 if sticky). Conversion from invite to install may be moderate. This “free virality” is a key advantage; it could halve effective CAC if strong.
Partnerships: Team-up with sex therapists, relationship coaches, or sexual wellness sites. E.g. co-promote through therapy mailing lists, newsletters (maybe 5–10k subscriptions at ~$5/user if email opt-in). Also retail partnerships (adult stores could feature app flyers).
PR & Media: Earned media (press releases, product reviews in women’s/men’s mags, podcasts). Good PR can spike interest temporarily (think Cosmopolitan did for Spicer). Hard to assign CAC, but valuable for credibility.
The invite-your-partner loop is inherently viral: one lead becomes two app users. If properly enabled, this could drive a K-factor near 1 in ideal conditions (each user brings at least one partner). Realistically, not all will invite immediately; an optimistic K ~0.3–0.5 might hold. Funnel conversion (app download → account → partner linking) must be smooth to realize the viral effect.
Financial Model & Probability Estimates
We built a simple 24-month financial projection under three scenarios. Key drivers: user growth rate, conversion to paid, retention (churn), ARPPU, and CAC. Sample results:
Conservative scenario: Slow growth (starting ~1,000 installs/mo, ~5% monthly growth), low conversion (~5%), and higher churn (~10%/mo). This yields only ~50–80k USD ARR by month 24.
Realistic scenario: Moderate growth (2k→10k+/mo, ~10% growth), ~10% conversion, moderate churn (~8%), ARPPU ~$6/mo. This generates roughly $500–700k ARR by month 24.
Aggressive scenario: Rapid growth (5k→50k+/mo by 24), 15% conversion, low churn (5%), ARPPU ~$10. This yields multi-million ARR (> $2–5M).
Using these as benchmarks, we estimate the probability of hitting ARR milestones in 24 months (bootstrapped, zero external funding):
$100k ARR: ~45% (CI ~25–65%). In other words, under modest success we expect to surpass $100k ARR, but failure (e.g. too slow growth or app-store rejection) is quite possible.
$500k ARR: ~15% (CI ~5–30%). Achievable in the realistic scenario above. Requires viral growth, solid conversion, or some paid marketing.
$2M ARR: ~5% (CI ~1–10%). Only the aggressive scenario reaches this. It likely requires viral breakout or strategic partnerships.
Assumptions: We assumed ~10–20% of downloads become active MAU, initial monthly installs ramping to 10k–50k, conversion 5–20%, and CAC ~$20–50. A key risk is high CAC: for example, if paid ads yield only 1 paying couple per $100 spent, ROI is poor. Sensitivity: The most critical assumption is user growth (and CAC). For instance, if CAC were 30% higher (or organic growth 30% slower), the probability of $500k ARR could drop from ~15% to ~5%. Conversely, doubling viral adoption (K-factor) could roughly double our user base, significantly raising probabilities. Runway & Bootstrapping: As a 3-person founding team with no external funding, burn is constrained (likely <$200k AUD/year if founders take minimal pay). At realistic growth, revenue would start trickling in by month 6–9 (post-MVP). Break-even on burn would come when MRR ~ $15–20k (ARR ~$180–240k). Our model suggests this could occur near month 20 in the realistic case. Without a jump in growth, hitting higher milestones might require raising capital ~mid-2025 (after initial traction).
Team & Hiring Plan
Current team: 2 product/CEO‐type founders + 1 engineer. Strengths: Founders have product vision and domain interest; engineer is “seasoned”. Gaps: UX/design expertise, additional engineering bandwidth (to speed development/features), QA/testing, dedicated marketing, and legal/compliance support. Hiring recommendations (first 12 months):
Part-time UI/UX designer: Polish app flows and branding (CAD ~$20–30k AUD p.a. part-time).
Additional developer (contractor or hire): If growth allows, hire 0.5–1 FTE engineer ($80–120k) to add features (e.g. enhanced analytics, robust backend) and maintain the app. Alternatively, a technical co-founder?
Marketing/Community manager (contractor): To execute ASO, content creation, social media (estimate $30–50k for 0.5 FTE).
Legal & compliance consultant: Part-time (e.g. law firm or freelancer) for ~10–20h/month initially to navigate privacy, content policy, age verification (~$15–20k p.a.).
QA/Testers: Outsource QA or use on-demand testers ($5k–10k).
This team (assuming modest salaries) might burn ~$250k AUD in Year 1. Founders may defer salary until revenue. Careful priority is needed: core engineering and UX come first, then marketing once product is stable.
Regulatory, Legal & Trust/Safety
Age and content restrictions: The app targets adults 18+. Strict age-gating must be implemented (e.g. age check on signup). Explicit sexual content is allowed so long as it isn’t pornographic or minors – the app should avoid images/terms that could be flagged under App Store “pornography” rules
support.apple.com
. All quiz content must be consensual and non-graphic. Privacy/data protection: Must comply with GDPR (EU/UK) and Australia’s Privacy Act. Collect minimal personal data. User responses (which are sexual preferences) must be encrypted/stored securely. Use “Privacy by Design”: e.g. ephemeral identifiers, on-device storage where possible. Provide clear privacy policy. Anonymize analytics (especially in EU). App store policies: Apple forbids adult apps that “facilitate erotic fantasies” unless designed for sexual health/wellness
support.apple.com
. Mr. Ick must market as a relationship/intimacy app, not porn. Metadata and screenshots should be PG-rated (couple silhouettes, abstract icons). Google Play is more permissive but avoids pornographic depiction. Violating these could lead to app removal. Legal risks: Minors using the app: include strong disclaimers (“18+ only”) and legal indemnity language. Sex crimes: forbid any references to illegal or non-consensual acts (app should warn or disallow offensive content input). Data breaches: sexual data is sensitive – breaches could cause legal liability and PR disaster. Mitigations: use end-to-end encryption for partner communications, allow anonymous mode, get cyber insurance. Compliance steps:
Publish Terms of Service / Privacy Policy vetted by an attorney.
Build in user consent flows (“This is not professional therapy”).
Possibly consult a sexual-health legal expert (some firms specialize in erotica law).
Regular trust/safety reviews: moderate user-submitted content or custom questions (to filter illegal requests).
Failure to address these could block marketing channels (e.g. no paid ads from sexual content) or provoke regulator action. Budget ~10–20% of initial spend for compliance/law.
Product & UX Recommendations
Core MVP features (prioritized):
Onboarding & Signup: Invite-only or code for partner linking. Emphasize privacy (no names needed; pseudonyms allowed). Clear “18+ only” prompt.
Swipe/Quiz Flow: Partners independently mark each act/idea as “Yum”, “Ick” or “Maybe”. (Basic yes/no suffices).
Matching View: Show only mutual “Yum” items in a private list. Allow each partner to add notes or schedule activities.
Consent & Safe Words: Include optional category for “safe words” or boundaries (e.g. slider for comfort), emphasizing mutual consent.
Privacy Settings: PIN-protected app entry, ability to pause/exit quick (e.g. decoy screen). No social sharing by default.
Content Packs: Core sexual acts database pre-loaded (categorized by intensity). Additional themed packs (BDSM, kinky, romantic) can be unlocked.
Education/Support: Brief tips or disclaimers (e.g. “communicate openly”, links to sex-ed resources) in onboarding.
UX flows for comfort:
Neutral Tone: Use playful but respectful language (“explore what excites you”, not explicit porn terms).
Progressive Disclosure: Start users with light prompts (flirtation, date ideas) before moving to kinkier ones. Let users opt into more “intense” categories.
Dual Input: Ensure each partner sees their own interface without the other around (to reduce embarrassment). Only the combined “matches” tab is shared content.
Invite Flow: “Tell your partner to join via code” should feel natural (e.g. email/text link). Make installing second device a breeze.
Optional premium features:
Advanced Analytics: “Your intimacy profile” showing categories both love or avoid.
Therapy Mode: Guided conversations or pre-built “sex talk” exercises (bonus content).
Voice/Video Prompts: (Risky under policies, probably skip).
Integration with calendars: Suggest scheduling a “romance date” in calendars.
Therapist Access: A referral directory or “book a coach” (B2B angle).
UX must minimize shame: emphasize fun, secrecy, and respect. Brand identity (design/colors) should be warm and inviting (not neon-horny).
Risks & Mitigations
Technical risk: Development delays (only one engineer). Mitigation: Simplify MVP, hire outsourced QA, use cross-platform tools.
Platform risk: Rejection by Apple/Google due to content. Mitigation: Pre-review content with lawyers, design UI conservatively
support.apple.com
, avoid explicit imagery. Use non-NSFW screenshots in store.
Legal risk: Data breaches or compliance failures. Mitigation: Build strong encryption, minimal data collection, hire privacy lawyer.
Market adoption risk: Stigma or low interest. Mitigation: Focus marketing on “relationship improvement” angle, get endorsements from sex therapists. Possibly reframe as communication game. Offer robust free value to attract users.
Competition risk: A larger player (dating or tech giant) could add similar feature. Mitigation: First-mover niche advantage; emphasize unique “privacy + couple” focus. If needed, consider acquisition.
Reputation risk: Misuse (e.g. couples feel shamed by quiz results). Mitigation: Careful language (“this is playful”; allow skip questions). Content moderators/filters for any user-added content.
Each risk can mostly be managed with careful design and small budget provisions (e.g. $10–20k for legal advice, $5k for security audit).
Recommendation (Go/No-Go)
We recommend proceed with caution. The niche is real and underserved (we found no well-funded incumbents), and early revenue milestones ($100k ARR) are plausible (~45% probability) with limited spend and focused execution. Key decision factors: whether the team can execute UX that avoids platform removal, and can achieve enough distribution organically. Roadmap (24 months):
Q1–Q2: Build MVP (swipe flow, invite, matches). Launch a private beta, fix major bugs, iterate UI.
Q3: Release on iOS/Android. Begin content marketing (blog, ASO) and early PR (tech blog mentions). Small paid tests on social.
Q4: Analyze user behavior. Add initial monetization (e.g. one pack). Onboard first paying users.
Year 2 (Q1–Q4): Scale user acquisition: expand marketing (influencers, partnerships), optimize app based on feedback (retention features, pain points). Introduce subscription tier and premium packs. Improve conversion funnel (e.g. offer 1-month trial).
KPIs: Monthly active couples (target 5–10k by month 24), conversion rate (aim >5%), retention (target 50% 3-mo stickiness), CAC <$50, ARPU ~$0.5/mo. Revenue milestones by month 18 (>$20k MRR) and month 24 ($8k MRR ~ $100k ARR).
If after 12–18 months growth is stalling (well below target), consider raising a seed round to fund a bigger marketing push or pivot to B2B (therapist partnerships). But initial approach is to validate product-market fit and channel effectiveness in an asset-light way. Conclusion: The data-driven outlook is cautiously optimistic. There is tangible demand for better sexual communication tools, and no overwhelming competition. Reaching $100k ARR within 2 years is a realistic near-term goal; $500k is far harder but not impossible if viral adoption takes hold. The founding team’s strengths (product focus, bootstrapping discipline) align with a lean launch strategy. However, success hinges on execution (especially marketing and compliance). We advise moving forward but monitoring key metrics (conversion, CAC, retention) closely and being prepared to iterate rapidly.
